**Executive Summary**  
Safecast’s “Open=Safe” project seeks €500,000 in funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme to deliver a series of community‑based workshops across Europe. Over 24 months, we will host 25 hands‑on workshops (each with up to 10 participants) led by three certified instructors. Participants will assemble and calibrate open‑source BGeigie Zen radiation detectors, learn data‑collection protocols, and contribute to Safecast’s global open‑data platform. By empowering communities with the tools and knowledge to measure and share real‑time radiation data, “Open=Safe” will foster transparency, citizen science, and a safer, more informed Europe.

## 1. Project Background and Rationale

Since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in 2011, Safecast has pioneered open‑source radiation monitoring, running over 150 workshops worldwide and building a community of over 5,000 contributors. However, Europe’s diverse regulatory environments and public awareness levels mean that many regions still lack local capacity for transparent radiation monitoring. The “Open=Safe” project addresses this gap by:

- **Empowering citizens** with practical skills and low‑cost, open‑source hardware.
- **Strengthening resilience** through locally generated, verifiable data.
- **Promoting open science** and data‑sharing practices across borders.

By leveraging Safecast’s proven methodology and network, “Open=Safe” will standardise best practices and create a pan‑European community of radiation monitors.

## 2. Objectives

1. **Capacity Building:** Train 250 participants in open‑source radiation monitoring techniques.
2. **Hardware Deployment:** Distribute and assemble 250 BGeigie Zen kits.
3. **Data Generation:** Contribute at least 10 million data points to the Safecast platform.
4. **Community Formation:** Establish 10 active regional user groups to sustain local monitoring.
5. **Open‑Data Advocacy:** Publish workshop materials and datasets under open licenses.

## 8. Conclusion

“Open=Safe” leverages Safecast’s 13 years of proven expertise to build European capacity for transparent radiation monitoring. By funding workshops, hardware, and expert instructors, the EU will catalyse a pan‑European citizen‑science network, driving data‑driven environmental governance and reinforcing public trust. We respectfully request €500,000 to realise this vision of an open and safe Europe.
