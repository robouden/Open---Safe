**Project Proposal: Open=Safe: Empowering Communities Through Open-Source Radiation Monitoring**

**1. Executive Summary:**

Open=Safe is a project initiated by Safecast to empower communities worldwide by providing them with the knowledge and tools to monitor radiation levels in their environment. Building on Safecast's 13 years of experience in successful community-based workshops, this project will establish a series of hands-on workshops focused on building and utilizing open-source, real-time radiation detection devices (bgeigieZen kits). By fostering local expertise and providing access to reliable data, Open=Safe aims to create a more informed, resilient, and safer world. This proposal seeks funding to cover instructor costs, workshop materials, and bgeigieZen hardware kits.

**2. Problem Statement:**

Access to accurate and transparent radiation data is often limited, particularly in areas with potential environmental risks or limited resources. This lack of information can lead to public anxiety, hinder effective decision-making, and impede community resilience. Open=Safe addresses this problem by democratizing access to radiation monitoring technology and empowering communities to take ownership of their environmental safety.

**3. Project Goals and Objectives:**

- **Goal:** To empower communities worldwide to monitor radiation levels in their environment using open-source technology.
- **Objectives:**
  - Conduct a series of community-based workshops in [Specify target regions/countries].
  - Train participants in the assembly, calibration, and operation of bgeigieZen radiation detectors.
  - Create a network of trained individuals capable of collecting and sharing radiation data.
  - Contribute to the expansion of Safecast's open-source radiation database, providing publicly accessible data for informed decision-making.
  - Foster a culture of transparency and community engagement in environmental monitoring.

**4. Project Activities:**

- **Workshop Development:** Develop a standardized workshop curriculum covering radiation basics, bgeigieZen assembly, data collection protocols, and data interpretation.
- **Instructor Training:** Recruit and train experienced instructors to lead workshops in various locations.
- **Workshop Implementation:** Conduct workshops with a maximum of 10 participants per session, led by three instructors. Workshops will include hands-on assembly of bgeigieZen kits, calibration exercises, and data collection practice.
- **Data Management:** Integrate data collected by workshop participants into the Safecast open-source database.
- **Community Engagement:** Foster ongoing communication and collaboration among workshop participants and the broader Safecast community.

**5. Project Methodology:**

Open=Safe will utilize a participatory, hands-on approach to empower communities. Workshops will be designed to be accessible to individuals with varying levels of technical expertise. The open-source nature of the bgeigieZen allows for customization and adaptation to local needs. Safecast's established data management protocols will ensure data quality and accessibility.

Okay, based on the search results from Safecast's website, the bgeigieZen kit costs approximately $475 USD. The bgeigieNano kit is listed at $350.

Here's an updated budget section for your proposal, assuming you're planning to use the bgeigieZen kit and want to train 100 people:

**7. Budget:**

The requested funding will cover the following expenses:

- **Instructor Fees:** \[Amount] (Includes instructor salaries/stipends and travel expenses) - _This will depend on the number of workshops, instructor rates, and travel costs. You'll need to estimate this based on your planned locations and instructor availability._
- **bgeigieZen Kits:** $47,500 USD (100 kits x $475 per kit)
- **Workshop Materials:** \[Amount] (Consumables, printed materials, etc.) - _Estimate the cost of materials needed for each workshop (e.g., batteries, soldering supplies if needed, printed guides) and multiply by the number of workshops._
- **Workshop Venue Rental (if applicable):** \[Amount] - _If you need to rent space for the workshops, include an estimate of rental costs._
