## Executive Summary

Safecast proposes a partnership with universities and high schools in Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC), Bhutan, to conduct hands-on workshops empowering students and educators to build and deploy open-source bGeigieZen radiation monitoring devices. These workshops will enable Bhutan to collect and share its first open radiation data, placing the country on the global Safecast radiation map. This initiative aligns with GMC’s vision for sustainability, innovation, and mindful development.

Travel and instructor logistics will be finalized in close consultation with Joi Ito and his team, ensuring alignment with local needs and the broader vision of the project.
