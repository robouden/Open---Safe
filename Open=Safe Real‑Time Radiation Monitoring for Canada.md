# Open=Safe: Real‑Time Radiation Monitoring for Canada

## Executive Summary

Safecast’s **Open=Safe** project seeks CAD 750,000 in funding to establish a community‑based real‑time radiation monitoring network around Canada’s nuclear facilities, with an initial focus on the area surrounding the Pickering Power Plant in Ontario. Over a 24‑month period, Safecast will conduct hands‑on workshops in selected communities, where up to 10 participants per session will learn to build and operate open‑source BGeigie Zen radiation detectors. These detectors will be deployed for real‑time monitoring, with data streamed to an open‑access platform. The project aims to empower communities, enhance transparency in environmental monitoring, and ensure public safety by providing independent, real‑time radiation data.

## 1. Project Background and Rationale

Canada has long maintained a strong commitment to nuclear safety, yet community concerns persist regarding the potential environmental impact of nuclear facilities. With the success of Safecast’s global workshops and its proven track record in citizen‑science radiation monitoring, **Open=Safe** intends to extend this model to Canada. By equipping local communities with the knowledge and tools to monitor radiation levels in real‑time, the project will:

- **Empower Local Communities:** Enable citizens to take an active role in monitoring environmental safety around nuclear facilities.
    
- **Enhance Transparency:** Provide independent, open‑access radiation data, fostering trust between the public, regulatory agencies, and the nuclear industry.
    
- **Support Emergency Preparedness:** Establish a real‑time data network that can aid in timely decision-making in case of a radiation incident.
    

## 2. Objectives

1. **Capacity Building:** Train 200 participants from communities near nuclear facilities in open‑source radiation monitoring.
    
2. **Hardware Deployment:** Assemble and deploy 200 BGeigie Zen radiation detectors.
    
3. **Data Generation:** Collect and stream at least 15 million data points to the Safecast open‑data platform.
    
4. **Community Engagement:** Form five regional monitoring groups to ensure local, sustained radiation surveillance.
    
5. **Transparency & Safety:** Publish all data and workshop materials under open licenses to support public trust and safety.
