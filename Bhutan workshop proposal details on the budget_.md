Ten complete kits, each including a professional-grade Geiger counter (using the LND7317 tube[^2]), GPS, microcontroller, battery, and enclosure. These are the same devices used by Safecast volunteers worldwide for consistent, high-quality data collection[^2][^3].
- **Shipping \& Import (\$75):**
Covers international shipping and any customs duties for bringing the kits and materials into Bhutan.
- **Educational Materials (\$300):**
Professionally printed assembly instructions, radiation science guides, and field notebooks for data recording. Includes translation of key materials into Dzongkha to ensure accessibility for all participants.
- **Workshop Supplies (\$350):**
Includes rental or purchase of soldering irons, hand tools, safety goggles, and extension cords. These are essential for safe and effective kit assembly and may be reusable for future workshops.

### **Budget Notes**

- **Instructor travel and related logistics** will be finalized with Joi Ito (Japanese entrepreneur, technologist, and former MIT Media Lab director) and his team, leveraging their expertise in international collaboration and local context.
- If the host institution provides venue and/or tools, costs may be reduced accordingly.
- This budget is for one workshop (10 participants); additional workshops will scale proportionally.
- All Safecast data collected will be openly published and integrated into the global Safecast map, putting Bhutan’s radiation baseline on the world stage[^2][^4].

This budget ensures a transparent, practical, and locally adaptable approach for launching Safecast’s first Bhutan workshop, with flexibility for international collaboration.
